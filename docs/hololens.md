### Vergence-accommodation conflict
Users wearing HoloLens will always accommodate to 2.0m to maintain a clear image because the HoloLens displays are fixed at an optical distance approximately 2.0m away from the user(fixed accommodation). *However*, their eyes will converge according to the distance between a hologram and their eyes(free vergence). So while accommodation and vergence are coupled in natural environment, they are decoupled in VR/AR.
